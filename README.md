 ðŸ‘‹ Alright? I'm Dave,

ðŸŒ± I've been coding for a few years, and I like using and improving my skill in React JS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express,
and CSS. 
I am currently learning; MongoDB, Typescript, Tailwind, and React Native.

Other than coding I also enjoy spending my time
Skateboarding, Long bike trips with friends, Hiking and camping, watching Formula 1, and gaming.
