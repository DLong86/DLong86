# ðŸ‘‹ Alright? I'm Dave (DLong86),

ðŸŒ± I've been coding for a few years, and I'm passionate about using and improving my skills in React JS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and CSS. I'm constantly striving to expand my knowledge and currently, I'm focused on learning MongoDB, TypeScript, and React Native.

# Interests
When I'm not coding, you can find me engaged in various activities:
- Skateboarding: I've enjoyed skating for a long time and learning new tricks
- Playing the guitar: I'm into music and playing the guitar relaxes me
- Exploring the outdoors with friends on long bike trips is one of my favorite things to do.
- Watching motorsport: I love watching Formula 1 and other types of racing.
