# ðŸ‘‹ Alright? I'm Dave (DLong86),

ðŸŒ± I've been coding for a few years, and I'm passionate about using and improving my skills in React JS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and CSS. I'm constantly striving to expand my knowledge and currently, I'm focused on learning MongoDB, Python, and React Native.

# Interests
When I'm not coding, you can find me engaged in various activities:
- Spending time with my two young daughters.
- Skateboarding: I love skateboarding, not so keen on falling off though.
- Playing the guitar: I love music and try to play the guitar without annoying my family too much.
- Riding my bike and going on bike trips with friends.
- Watching motorsport: I love watching Formula 1 and other types of racing.
